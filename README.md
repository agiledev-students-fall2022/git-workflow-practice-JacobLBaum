## Why It's Interesting
This article discusses the impact OpenAI's new DALL-E text to image generator has had on architectural design. DALL-E has offered a much quicker and easier way for trained and untrained architects to quickly drum up their ideas and also get inspiration for new ideas.

This is just one of the innumerable applications of DALL-E. The powerful tool impacts many creative arts in ways we are only starting to see.


### Brandon Somoza's Comment

The DALL-E text to image generator seems incredibly useful and very interesting! Being able to take jumbled words and phrases and turn them into a physical/real architectural design is a truly innovative creation. Although it seems like it might lead to some outlandish designs, those are things that can be polished with time. Super cool article!
